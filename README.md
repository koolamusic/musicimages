# MUSIC IN IMAGES MIM

### Hi Guys,
 

I have a project that I have developed as part of my thesis which I wanted to show and request some feedback.
 
Its called 'Music in Images' and it is based on algorithmic music  composition from digital images. It presents an approach where visual  art (or visual data) is transformed into music art (or sound data)  through the application of an algorithmic filter.

The application of this project will be viewable online and I am looking to get feedback on it. I am requesting your viewpoint regarding the application of this project in the field of psychology, for exploring relationships  between images, computer generated music and human emotional  interpretation. 
This project presents a new approach towards algorithmic music  composition where the music is composed using the pixel values of  digital images.

## Application Info:

```
The application makes use of image data, such as: pixel Color,  Saturation, Brightness, and qualities like: Overall Image Brightness,  Color Variation and Prominent Colors.
Each of the above properties contribute towards composition of the  music. The song attributes controlled by them include: Melody  generation, Durations, Cord Generation, Chord Progression, Tempo,Scale  and Transposition.
The theory behind the translation of image attributes to music  attributes is based on previous works done in the field of psychology,  in the topic: perceptual associations of audio frequency and music modes  with hue, saturation and brightness. In addition to this, there are  certain translation techniques which are based on the my artistic sense. 
Pixels : Similar Color regions : Overall Image
Notes : Chords : Scale

## Issues to Deal with:

```
1. You can try out different images and play them using the given instrument options. What are your impressions on the quality of the music produced ?
2. If you are a musician, can this application be useful to you ?
3. If you area a psychologist, do you think this application can be used for exploring relationships between images, computer generated music and human emotional interpretation?
Feel free to add any other questions/ comments that you might like.
